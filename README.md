# Analyzing-Personal-Expenses-Project

Project Overview:
This project simulates an expense tracker for an individual, utilizing the Faker library to generate realistic monthly expense data. The data is processed, stored in a SQL database, and SQL queries are created to derive insights into spending behavior. A user-friendly Streamlit app visualizes these insights, showcasing an individual's spending patterns across categories like bills, groceries, subscriptions, and personal spending over a year.
